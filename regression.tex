The current model, no regression.

        \mathcal{PG}_p\left(\bm{Y}\mid\bm{\alpha}_i,\bm{1}\right)\\

    ~\hspace{1cm}
    \begin{aligned}
        G_0 &= {\textstyle\prod}_{\ell = 1}^{d}\mathcal{LN}(\alpha_{\ell}\mid \exp(\theta_i^t\beta), \sigma_{\ell}^2)\\
        \beta_{k\ell} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta\sim\mu_0,\sigma_0^2)\\
        \sigma_{\ell}^2 &\sim \mathcal{IG}(\sigma^2\mid\nu,\psi)

Notation is really awkward, but this is effectively the proposed model.  Note in particular the expectation of $\lvert \bm{\beta}\rvert = d * \lvert \theta\rvert$.  Is this reasonable?  If we are predicting a massive multivariate vector using a small number of predictors (in this case, the storm properties vector is length 5).  It seems like we could make this a bit less unwieldy...

Do you have any suggestion of literature for multivariable GLM I should read?

Choice of log-normal vs gamma centering distribution in the proposed model comes down to practicality with regression.  I'd prefer it describe the mean vector (or log-mean, as it were), but that would only work if we fixed rate to 1.
