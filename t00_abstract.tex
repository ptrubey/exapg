In order to account for the model flexibility required by the multivariate
    peaks-over-threshold scenario, a Dirichlet process mixture model using
    the projection of independent gamma random variables onto the unit 
    hypersphere under the $\mathcal{L}_p$ norm was developed.  This very
    quickly presents computational issues, as the computational burden for
    MCMC inference scales superlinearly with sample size, and will scale
    either linearly or exponentially depending on choice of centering 
    distribution. We propose an alternate approach, developing a 
    variational Bayes approach for model inference.  We apply this model
    to a dataset of simulations of storm surge; comprised of 5 thousand
    observations at more than 3 million locations.
