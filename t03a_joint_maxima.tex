\subsection{Applications of Extremal Dependence}
Following the example of \cite{trubey:pg}, we can use the dependence structure we infer the dependence
    by fitting the model in Equation~\eqref{eqn:pypg}.  Then, conditional on



The standard Pareto distribution exhibits a multiplicative memory-less property such that
\[
\text{P}(Z > st \mid Z > s) = P(Z > t)\text{ for }s,t \geq 1
\]

\subsection{Multi-site Return Periods}
Statistical inference of extreme values tends to focus on the \emph{return period} as a deliverable
    metric.  In a univariate case, this is relatively easy to define: for event $z$, the return period
    is the average \emph{time} it would take to observe a new event $Z$ as extreme or more extreme than $z$.
    that is,
    \[
    T(z) = \frac{\mu}{1 - F_z(z)}
    \]
    where $\mu$ is the average inter-arrival time in a series of events. Conceptual problems begin to arise
    in interpretation when we consider a multivariate $F$. 
    \makenote{extreme analysis book makes succinct argument; quote.}
    \cite{cho2023} avoids this issue of interpretation by estimating univariate return periods for each
    indexed location within a spatial field, along with low-dimensional multivariate extreme analysis 
    on different summary statistics, assessed over the aggregate spatial field: flood volume, 
    peak discharge, total rainfall depth, and maximum wind speed.
    A more analogous approach to ours, in that they consider the dependence structure of extreme values of 
    the same summary statistic, between different points in space may be found in \cite{salvadori2010}.  They
    consider yearly maximum observed flow rates between 4 of 17 available flow meters on a river catchment
    in Britain. \makenote{
        Inference task size: 4 locations $\times$ 37 years available.  I suspect the problem,
        or why they're not more ambitious in terms of scale, is one of interpretation: more than 4 dimensions 
        makes presenting results difficult.  Also, lack of data (\# of years).
        }
    Beyond the conceptual issue of interpreting a multivariate $F$, there arises a practical issue in presenting
    complete results of a higher dimensional process.
       
\subsection{Conditional Survival}
One of the more compelling applications of modelling the dependence structure between locations in 
    storm surge lies in the reality that a storm surge occurs over a period of time, and the 
    maximum observed values in storm surge at different sites occur asynchronously.  A decision maker,
    interested in the storm surge at a smaller group of locations, can observe storm surge at other
    locations, and make an inference about the probability of catastrophic flooding at their locations
    of interest and make an informed decision.
    Equation~\eqref{eqn:condsurv}, from Proposition~2 of \cite{trubey:pg} offers us a means by which 
    this can be accomplished.
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:condsurv}
        \text{Pr}\left[\bigcap_{s\in\alpha}Z_s \geq z_s\;\middle|\;\bigcap_{s\not\in\alpha}Z_s \geq z_s\right] =
        \frac{
            \text{E}\left[\bigwedge_{s=1}^S 1\wedge \frac{V_s}{z_s}\right]
        }{
            \text{E}\left[\bigwedge_{s\not\in\alpha} 1\wedge \frac{V_s}{z_s}\right]
        }
    \end{equation}
    Letting Set $\alpha$ be a group of locations of interest, we can establish the probability of
    entering a failure region, conditional on the current state and potential future state of the inundation 
    field.  Say, given current storm flooding near the mouth of the Delaware Bay, will the Philadelphia 
    International Airport, situated on the Delaware river, experience catastrophic flooding?  If one can 
    describe the dependence structure of extremes in inundation, Equation~\ref{eqn:condsurv} offers a 
    practical, actionable metric.

    \makenote{Select a few locations of interest in each inference task; establish conditional survival 
    probabilities for each given a few }
    
    The framework of multivariate EVT does not allow for the concept of negative dependence.  In fact, 
    a peaks-over-threshold approach using the projected gamma to model the dependence structure can not 
    encompass even complete independence: the closest we can envision is a weak positive dependence.
    As such, it is difficult to accurately model phenomena that 
    Never the less, \makenote{making a statement about the probability of simultaneous flooding in new york and virginia.}
